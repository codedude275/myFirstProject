  <p> Some of the things that I am currently interested in are things like music.
  I absolutely love music and especially the deeper meanings that some different
  songs have. My favorite band though, would have to be Twenty One Pilots at the moment.
I also really love watching movies to enjoy them and also to be a huge critic to annoy my friends
and family. Another thing is soccer. I really do enjoy playing it although I'm not the best, and watching it
as well is entertaining. My favorite cartoon is Regular Show, which is pictured at the bottom of this text.</p>

    Below is my school, and while it may look pretty epic, you're wrong because it is extremely small and the people there kinda suck.
